# Written Analysis

## Summary
The district comprises 15 schools, with the overall passing rates in key academic areas being 75% for math and 86% for reading. However, only 65% of students pass both math and reading. The data reveals significant differences between the performance of charter and district schools, school size, and school spending.
Charter schools are the top performers in the district, consistently outperforming district schools in math and reading. Notably, the larger schools in the district tend to have lower passing rates, and schools with the lowest per-student spending show the highest overall passing percentages.

## Conclusions and Comparisons
Charter Schools Outperform District Schools
* Charter schools have higher passing rates than district schools, suggesting more effective teaching or better resource use in charter schools.

Smaller, Lower-Spending Schools Perform Better
* Schools with lower per-student spending and smaller sizes have higher passing rates, possibly due to more individualized attention and efficient resource use.
